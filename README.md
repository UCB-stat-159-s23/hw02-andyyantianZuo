## Homework No 2 - From Notebooks to Research Packages
### This project is a reproducible research package that uses the LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial Notebook and companion files available on Github. The package is structured to include installable utilities separated into a small Python package, a Conda environment specification, and a new Binder link.

### To launch the Binder environment for this project, click on the Binder badge below:

### Once launched, the environment will land on the JupyterLab interface by default, with the main LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb notebook already open.
